## Prompt

I'm working on the TGIF Phase 2 Franchisee Playbook and need to create a "best of" rollout tracking template by combining the strengths of two existing spreadsheets that Becky (Operations Lead) has reviewed and liked.

**Context:**
- TGIF is a restaurant management system being rolled out to franchisee groups in 2026
- We have two rollout tracking templates with different approaches
- Need to create a unified template that captures the best features of both
- The template will be used to track store go-lives, onsite support schedules, and rollout coordination

**I'm uploading two rollout tracking templates:**

1. **Template A** — Generic 2026 TGIF Go-Live Rollout template
2. **Template B** — Jackmont-specific 2026 TGIF Go-Live Rollout template

**Please analyze and provide:**

1. **Comparative Analysis**
   - What columns/fields does each template include?
   - What information is tracked in Template A but not Template B (and vice versa)?
   - Which template has better organization/structure?
   - Which template has more useful detail for operations teams?

2. **Strengths of Each Template**
   - Template A strengths (what should we keep?)
   - Template B strengths (what should we keep?)
   - Any redundant or unnecessary fields in either template?

3. **Recommended "Best Of" Structure**
   - Proposed column headers for the unified template
   - Data types and validation rules for each column
   - Recommended sheet structure (single sheet vs. multiple tabs)
   - Sorting/filtering recommendations

4. **Operational Improvements**
   - What critical information is missing from both templates?
   - What fields would improve coordination between:
     - Operations team
     - Toast onsite support
     - Franchisee groups
     - Store managers
   - What status tracking or progress indicators should be added?

5. **Franchisee Group Considerations**
   - How should the template handle multiple franchisee groups?
   - Should there be group-specific views or filters?
   - What group-level metadata is needed (contact info, special requirements, etc.)?

6. **Template Proposal**
   - Provide a detailed column structure with:
     - Column name
     - Data type
     - Purpose/description
     - Example values
   - Include 3-5 sample rows showing realistic data
   - Recommend conditional formatting rules for visual clarity

**Deliverable:**
A structured assessment I can use to:
- Build the unified "best of" rollout tracking template
- Present to Becky for approval
- Use for all 2026 TGIF Phase 2 rollouts

**Additional Requirements:**
- Template must be easy to update weekly
- Must support filtering by franchisee group, week, status
- Should highlight upcoming go-lives and support needs
- Must be printable/shareable for weekly coordination meetings

## Follow-Up Questions (if needed)

If the initial response needs refinement, ask:
- "Can you provide more specific conditional formatting rules for status tracking?"
- "How should we handle schedule changes or delays in the template?"
- "What's the best way to track Toast onsite support assignments?"
- "Should we add a dashboard/summary tab? If so, what should it show?"
- "How can we make this template work for both weekly planning and historical tracking?"
