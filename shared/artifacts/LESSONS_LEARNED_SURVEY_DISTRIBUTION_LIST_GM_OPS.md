# TGIF Phase 2 — Lessons Learned Survey Distribution List (GM / Ops Only)

## Purpose
Send the Lessons Learned survey to GM + Ops recipients who directly experienced Phase 2 go-lives.

## Inclusion Criteria (GM/Ops only)
- GMs and/or Ops leaders who supported **stores that went live in 2025** (Phase 2).
- Regional/Area managers supporting those stores.
- Ops stakeholders directly responsible for rollout readiness/support.

## Known recipients (from current TGIF knowledge artifacts)
The following are the only GM/Ops recipients with **verifiable contact details** in the current workspace sources.

| Recipient Type | Name | Role | Email | Notes / Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ops | Samuel H. Langley | Operations | SLangley@fridays.com | TGIF_KNOWLEDGE.json `key_personnel.samuel_langley` | Ready |
| Ops (lead) | BH | Operations Lead | (missing) | TGIF_KNOWLEDGE.json `key_personnel.bh` (email not present) | Missing email |
| Ops/Hardware | Tiana Awerbuch | Hardware/Operations | (missing) | TGIF_KNOWLEDGE.json `key_personnel.tiana_awerbuch` | Missing email |
| Ops/Hardware | Mario Madaffari | Hardware/Operations | (missing) | TGIF_KNOWLEDGE.json `key_personnel.mario_madaffari` | Missing email |

## Store-level recipients (GMs / Store Managers) — placeholders
Meeting artifacts reference store managers but do not provide names/emails:
- “Store Manager - Dallas”
- “Store Manager - MA”

| Recipient Type | Franchise Group | Store / Location | Name | Role | Email | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GM/Store Manager | TBD | Dallas | (missing) | GM / Store Manager | (missing) | Missing name + email |
| GM/Store Manager | TBD | MA Stores (incl. 1887 / 1191 referenced) | (missing) | GM / Store Manager | (missing) | Missing name + email |

## Required inputs to finalize distribution list (blocking gaps)
To actually send the survey to the right GM/Ops recipients, we still need:

1) **List of 2025 go-live locations (14 locations referenced in Phase 2 docs)**
- Store name
- Store number
- Franchise group
- GM name
- GM email
- Regional manager name/email (if applicable)

2) **Email addresses for named Ops stakeholders without emails**
- BH
- Tiana Awerbuch
- Mario Madaffari

## Recommended next step
Provide (or point me to) the source of truth for GM/store contacts (the doc set references items like “Franchisee contacts.xlsx” / “2025 Rollout Details V21” outside this workspace). Once available, I’ll produce a clean final table with:
- Franchise group
- Store
- GM
- Regional/Ops leader
- Emails
- “Send survey?” flag
