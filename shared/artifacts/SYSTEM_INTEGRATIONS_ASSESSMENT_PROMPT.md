## Prompt

I'm working on the TGIF Phase 2 Franchisee Playbook and need to assess our current system integrations tracking against our project goals.

**Context:**
- TGIF is a restaurant management system being rolled out to franchisee groups
- We need to track and verify all system integrations (POS, accounting, inventory, etc.)
- The goal is to create a structured Google Sheet that tracks integration status, dependencies, and issues

**I'm uploading two worksheets:**

1. **Current Integration Tracking** — Our existing spreadsheet showing current integrations
2. **TGIF Phase 2 Goals/Requirements** — What we need to accomplish for the franchisee playbook

**Please analyze and provide:**

1. **Gap Analysis**
   - What integrations are documented in the current sheet?
   - What integrations are required but missing from current tracking?
   - What data fields are we tracking vs. what we should be tracking?

2. **Recommended Structure for New Google Sheet**
   - Column headers (e.g., Integration Name, Type, Status, Owner, Dependencies, Issues, Last Verified)
   - Required vs. optional fields
   - Categorization/grouping strategy (by system type, by franchisee group, etc.)

3. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - Are there inconsistencies in how integrations are documented?
   - Are there missing critical details (e.g., contact info, API versions, credentials location)?
   - What validation rules should we implement?

4. **Action Items**
   - What information needs to be gathered from Patricia (flat file integrations expert)?
   - What integrations need immediate verification?
   - What dependencies or blockers should be flagged?

5. **Template Proposal**
   - Provide a sample row structure for the new Google Sheet
   - Include example data for 2-3 integrations to illustrate the format

**Deliverable:**
A structured assessment I can use to:
- Build the new Google Sheet template
- Prepare questions for my meeting with Patricia (scheduled 1/5/26)
- Identify gaps that need immediate attention

## Follow-Up Questions (if needed)

If the initial response needs refinement, ask:
- "Can you provide a more detailed column structure with data types and validation rules?"
- "What's the priority order for gathering missing information?"
- "How should we handle integrations that vary by franchisee group?"
- "What metrics should we track to measure integration health?"
